  1 Pista nera (Il vicequestore Rocco Schiavone Vol. 1) (Italian Edition) -- Un vicequestore nato e cresciuto a Trastevere, che odia lo sci, le montagne, la neve e il freddo viene trasferito ad Aosta. Rocco Schiavone ha combinato qualcosa di grosso per meritare un esilio come questo. È un poliziotto corrotto, ama la bella vita. È violento, sarcastico nel senso più romanesco di esserlo, saccente, infedele, maleducato con le donne, cinico con tutto e chiunque, e odia il suo lavoro. Però ha talento. Una rilettura della tradizione del giallo all’italiana, capace di coniugare lo sguardo dolente del neorealismo e la risata sfrontata di una commedia di avanspettacolo.

  17 Vecchie conoscenze -- --
  18 Le ossa parlano -- Ein Arzt im Ruhestand entdeckt im Wald menschliche Knochen. Es ist der Leichnam eines Kindes. Michela Gambino von der Forensik in Aosta, privat so phantasievoll paranoid, dass Rocco Schiavone sich oft in der Psychiatrie wähnt, aber außerordentlich kompetent, schafft es, die wichtigsten Details zu ermitteln: etwa zehn Jahre alt, Tod durch Strangulation, wahrscheinlich Gewalt. Die Untersuchung der Funde, eine komplexe Ermittlung voller Hindernisse, führt schließlich zu einem Namen und einem Datum: Mirko, der sechs Jahre zuvor verschwunden war. Seine Mutter, eine alleinstehende Frau, hatte nie aufgegeben. Er wurde zuletzt gesehen, wie er nach dem Unterricht auf einer niedrigen Mauer in der Nähe der Schule saß und offenbar auf jemanden wartete. Ein kalter Fall für den Vize-Polizisten Schiavone, der ihn nicht wie üblich auf der zehnten Ebene löst, sondern mit schmerzhaftem Mitgefühl und mit dem Ekel, sich mit den Geheimcodes einer unmenschlichen Welt auseinandersetzen zu müssen. Eine Untersuchung, die ihn zwingt, logisch und systematisch vorzugehen, um Nachrichten und Hinweise aus dem Untergrund zu entschlüsseln. Und um eng mit seinen Kollegen und Untergebenen zusammenzuarbeiten, deren Privatleben er immer besser kennenlernt: Antonios rücksichtslose Liebesaffären, Italos Schiffbruch, Casellas und Derutas jüngste sentimentale Abrechnungen, sogar D'Intinos unerwartete Sensibilität, die im Grunde komischen Fixierungen der beiden Männer im Labor. Er ist von den Echos der Vergangenheit umgeben, zu denen der Geist von Marina, seiner ermordeten Frau, einen pulsierenden Kommentar abgibt. Er merkt immer mehr, dass er für andere Liebschaften unzureichend ist. Es ist, als ob die Einsamkeit zum anspruchsvollen Begleiter wird, ohne den er nicht auskommt. Dies ist vielleicht die grausamste Untersuchung von Rocco Schiavone.
